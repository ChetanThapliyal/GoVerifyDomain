# GoVerifyMail - Golang Email Verifier

GoMailWatch is a simple email verification tool built using GoLang that allows you to check the validity of email addresses. It performs various checks to ensure the email is correctly formatted, the domain has a valid MX record, and the address exists on the receiving mail server.

## Features

- Email format validation: GoMailWatch uses regular expressions to check if the provided email address follows a valid format.
- MX record validation: The application verifies if the domain of the email address has a valid Mail Exchange (MX) record, indicating the domain can accept emails.
- SMTP handshake: GoMailWatch performs an SMTP handshake to validate the existence of the email address on the receiving mail server.

## Prerequisites

- Go (Golang) version X.X.X or higher
